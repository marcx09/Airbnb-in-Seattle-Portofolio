# Airbnb in Seattle Portofolio
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Raw data
that I found from Kaggle for Airbnb Datasets. For data exploration I use SQL by Query and Create Data for Data Visualization. I move data from SQL to Excel by connect database
and do data cleaning in Excel. After data clean we can use Tableau for data visualization by creating dashboard.
