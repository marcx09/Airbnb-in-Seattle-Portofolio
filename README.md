# Airbnb in Seattle Portofolio
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stays. Raw data
that I found from Kaggle for Airbnb Datasets. For data exploration I use SQL by Query and Create Data for Data Visualization. I move data from SQL to Excel by connect database
and do data cleaning in Excel. After data clean we can use Tableau for data visualization by creating dashboard.

**What I Looking For?**
From this data what I want to know is About Host that Listing in Airbnb which had great rating and knowing what kind property that enlist in airbnb so I can know which kind
property that people choose when they go vacation for homestays.

**Data Visualization:**
Data Visualization that I create from SQL that I link to Excel for Visualization in Tableau. Github max upload file only 25MB so my excel file doesn't fit so i create link
to access excel data in Gdrive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nf_cTu5R0DFgJNU9SBbQbYBGV4c5MfYK?usp=sharing

Excel Formula Used for Data Cleaning:
- SUBSTITUTE
- REPLACE
